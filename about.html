  My name is Delilah, I’m in my late twenties. I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Chicago, Illinois. I am a Neonatal ICU nurse by trade a wanderlust by heart. I have lived in San Diego, New York City and Houston throughout my nursing career. I have always had an immense passion for traveling, I love meeting new people and experiencing new cultures. As of June 2016 I’ve quit my full time job and have have decided to travel the world solo.

  The purpose of this blog if for all of you to follow my journey as I solo travel around the world. I will post on my experience-the good, the bad and the amazing. I will offer tips on traveling as I begin to learn them myself. I am not a travel expert by any means, I am just here to share my story with you.
